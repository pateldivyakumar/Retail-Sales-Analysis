## 🔍 Key Analysis Components

### 1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

- Merged data from multiple Excel sheets (2009-2010 & 2010-2011)
- Removed missing customer IDs and duplicate records
- Filtered out negative/zero quantities
- Created calculated fields (TotalPrice = Quantity × Price)
- **Result**: Clean dataset with 779,495 transactions from 1,067,371 original records

### 2. **Sales Trend Analysis**

- **Monthly Sales Performance**: Time series analysis showing seasonal patterns and growth trends
- **Geographic Analysis**: Top 10 countries by sales revenue with interactive visualizations
- **Product Performance**: Top 10 best-selling products by quantity

### 3. **Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)**

- **Recency**: Days since last purchase
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases made
- **Monetary**: Total amount spent
- **Customer Scoring**: 4-tier scoring system (1-4) for each RFM dimension
- **Segmentation**: Combined RFM scores to identify customer segments

### 4. **Data Visualizations**

- Interactive Plotly charts for geographic sales distribution
- Time series plots for sales trends
- Scatter plots for customer segmentation analysis
- Distribution histograms for RFM score analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Core programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Static plotting and visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **Plotly** - Interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

### Sales Performance

- Clear seasonal patterns in monthly sales data
- Identification of peak sales periods
- Geographic concentration of sales in specific markets

### Customer Behavior

- Customer segmentation reveals distinct purchasing patterns
- RFM analysis identifies high-value customers
- Frequency vs. monetary value correlation analysis

### Product Analysis

- Top 10 products drive significant portion of total volume
- Product performance varies by geographic region
